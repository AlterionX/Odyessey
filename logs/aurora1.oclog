::It seems you have a problem on your hands, don't you. I've worried about this for a while.\n,
::But don't just sit there hoping your dad would come back.
::I know your dad, he is a wise and cunning man. He would not want you to be idle like this. You have a chance to save this situation, Terence. You must act soon, or else you will fail in saving anything worth saving. Dreaming may be a solution to your emotions, but it does not solve anything else in life.
